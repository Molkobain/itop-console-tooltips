# iTop extension: molkobain-console-tooltips

### Description
Display next to a field (console only), a question mark which pops-up the field description when it exists.

As part of the datamodel, a dictionnary entry (``'Class:<CLASS_NAME>/Attribute:<ATTRIBUTE_CODE>+' => 'Some description about the attribute'``) can be set on any field, to provide a long description to explain the usage of a particular field. This description can be more explicit to explain the meaning and expected usage of the field.

As part of the standard datamodel, only few fields have such description documented, especially because it is specific to the way an organization uses iTop. But with this extension, it's a good opportunity to enrich your dictionnary with business tooltips for online guidance to your users.

*Note: By default iTop has not much descriptions, if you want to add some, you have to add dictionary entries.*
